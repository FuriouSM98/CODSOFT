# CODSOFT Internship - Python Programming

Welcome to the repository for my CODSOFT internship in Python Programming! In this space, I've shared the code developed during the internship period.

## Repository Contents:

### TO-DO LIST
A To-Do List application designed to help users efficiently manage and organize their tasks. This Python project can be implemented as a command-line or GUI-based application. Users can create, update, and track their to-do lists, ensuring a straightforward and intuitive task management experience.

### PASSWORD GENERATOR
The Password Generator project focuses on creating a Python application that generates strong and random passwords. It prompts users to specify the desired length of the password and then utilizes a combination of random characters to create a password of the specified length. The generated password is displayed on the screen, providing a secure solution for password creation.

**Key Features:**
- **User Input:** Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
- **Generate Password:** Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.
- **Display the Password:** Print the generated password on the screen.

### CONTACT BOOK
The Contact Book project is designed to manage contact information efficiently. This Python application stores details such as name, phone number, email, and address for each contact. Users can add new contacts, view a list of all saved contacts, search for contacts by name or phone number, update contact details, and delete contacts. The project emphasizes creating a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

**Key Features:**
- **Contact Information:** Store name, phone number, email, and address for each contact.
